# codingFieldNotes
These "field notes" accomplish two things:
- a place for me to organize my notes for future reference
- documentation of my learning path

## My Learning Path
### Courses
In 2020, when I was at the height of my powers as a concert violinist, the world locked down. I pivoted into the world of web development and worked through [The Angela Yu Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). In 2021, I couldn't go back to playing the violin because I refused to take the experimental Covid shots. So I shook the dust off my sandals and pivoted into the maritime industry, where I worked as a commercial captain for a number of years. Now that I have stabilized in this field, it is time to return to my original design and steer a true course towards a career in front end web development.

## My Story in a Nutshell
In 2020, when I was at the height of my powers as a concert violinist, the world shut down and they tried to lock us in our homes. I escaped, winding through [The Angela Yu Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). In 2021, they wouldn't let me go back to playing the violin because I wouldn't take their experimental shots. Reasoning that being a "dime-a-dozen" violinist is no way to live, I shook the dust off my sandals and dove into the maritime industry. Now, having worked as a commercial captain for a few years, I am returning to my original plan and steering a true course towards frontend web development.

# codingFieldNotes
These "field notes" accomplish two things:
- a place for me to organize my notes for future reference
- documentation of my learning path

## My Learning Path
### Courses
In 2020, when I was at the height of my powers as a concert violinist, the world locked down. I pivoted into the remote web developer world and worked through [The Angela Yu Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). In 2021, the music industry shut me out because I refused to take the experimental Covid shots. So I turned my back for good on those losers and pivoted into the maritime industry, where I worked as a commercial captain for a number of years. Now that the dust has settled, I have determined the following path to finally reach my initial aim of becoming a front end web developer focusing on React.

myJsPathway is documentation of my journey into the world of Javascript coding.

## My Pathways
I am not beginning this at the start of my journey, as I am not completely new to jS. But I am still a fledgling nerd.
I finished [The Angela Yu Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), during the (authoritarian, tyrannical, and illegal) lockdowns.
I am 35% done with [The Jonas Schmedtmann Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
On deck is [Anthony Alicea JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/).

Then on to React...

# codingFieldNotes
These "field notes" accomplish two things:
- a place for me to organize my notes
- documentation of my coding learning path

## My Learning Path
### Courses
At the beginning of the lockdowns in 2020, I worked through [The Angela Yu Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). Then circumstances thrust me into the maritime industry where I have worked as a captain for a number of years. Now that the dust has settled, I have settled into the following path to finally become a front end web developer focusing on React.

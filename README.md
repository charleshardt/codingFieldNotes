## My Story in a Nutshell
- 2020: at the height of my powers as a concert violinist, the world shuts down and they try to lock us in our homes. I escape, winding through [The Angela Yu Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
- 2021: they won't let me go back to playing the violin because I won't take their experimental shots. So I shake the dust off my sandals, dive into the maritime industry, and work as a commercial captain.
- 2025: Having worked as a captain for a few years, I return to my original plan: I steer a true course towards frontend web development.

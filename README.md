# codingFieldNotes
This is documentation of my journey into the world of coding. It's also a place for me to organize my notes on things I'm learning.

## My Path
I am not beginning this at the start as I am not completely new to jS. Pretty new, though: I'm definitely a fledgling nerd. I finished [The Angela Yu Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) during the lockdowns. I am 35% done with [The Jonas Schmedtmann Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). Next up is [Anthony Alicea JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/).

Then on to React...

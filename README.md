# codingFieldNotes
These "field notes" accomplish two things:
- documentation of my coding learning path
- a place for me to organize my notes

## My Path
I have settled on the following learning path to ultimately become a front end developer focusing on React.

- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=851712)
- [JavaScript Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=364426)
	- [Github course](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=4188320)
	- [Secure Shell Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=1735124)
- [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=1026604)
	- [Clean Code](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=3611296)
- [React the Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=1362070)

	- [AI for Developers](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=6250531)
 - I am not beginning this at the start as I am not completely new to jS. Pretty new, though: I'm definitely a fledgling nerd. I finished [The Angela Yu Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) during the lockdowns. I am 35% done with [The Jonas Schmedtmann Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). Next up is [Anthony Alicea JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/).

Then on to React...

// 219-Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP

OOP: Programming style, or paradigm, based on objects. 

- Objects are used to model real-world (e.g. to-do list) or abstract (e.g. data structure) features.

- Pack data (object properties) and corresponding behavior (methods) into one block.

- Objects are self-contained blocks of code, which are used as building blocks of applications that interact with each other.

- Interactions happen through a public interface--API.

- OOP developed to organize code: make it more flexible, easier to maintain, less "spaghetti code."

- Functional programming is an alternative to OOP.

// Classes and Instances

- Classes provide the ability to generate objects programmatically. They are like a blueprint. Here is a class blueprint to create a user object. It has properties and methods:

Four Fundamental Principles to Good Class Implementation:
 1. Abstraction
 2. Encapsulation: making methods private within the class, preventing external code from manipulating internal properties/state (data). Encapsulation helps when changing code without breaking external code that relies on the object's methods.
 3. Inheritance: a child class inherits properties and methods from a parent class and extends them.
 4. Polymorphism: methods defined in a child class overwrite those inherited from a parent.

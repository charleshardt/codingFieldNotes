PLANNING STEP

1. USER STORIES. Description of the app's functionality from user's perspective. All user's stories combined describe th entire app.
Common Format (who, what, why): As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit].

 Mapty: 

 A. As a user, I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace, and steps/min, so I can keep a log of all my running.

 B. As a user, I want to log my cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed, and elevation gain, so I can keep a log of all my cycling.

 C. As a user, I want to see all my workouts at a glance, so I can easily track my progress over time.

 D. As a user, I want to see all my workouts on a map, so I can easily check where I work out the most.

 E. As a user, I want to see all my workouts when I leave the app and come back later, so that I can keep using the app over time.

2. FEATURES. All functionality needed to make the user stories happen.
 
 A1. Map where user clicks to add a new workout (best way to get location coordinates)

 A2. Geolocation to display map at current location (more user friendly)

 A3. Form to input distance, time, pace, steps/min
 
 B1. Form to input distance, time, speed, elevation gain

 C1. Display workouts in a list
 
 D1. Display workouts on a map

 E1. Store workout in the browser using local storage API

3. FLOWCHART. WHAT we build. Organization of the features into a visualization of all the actions a user can take and how the app reacts to the actions.

 In the wild, you don't come up with a final flowchart right at the beginning. A rough sketch gets the ball rolling, and it develops throughout implementation. Over time, the more you do it, the more you can plan ahead.

4. ARCHITECTURE. HOW we build it. What holds all the code together. How to organize the code, and which Js features to use.

 Just like the flowchart, it develops over time. Start coding, and update the architecture as the complexity develops.

DEVELOPMENT STEP. Implementation of planning steps 1-4.
